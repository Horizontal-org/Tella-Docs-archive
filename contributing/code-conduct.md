* [Principles](#principles)

* [Violations of the Code of Conduct](#what-represents-a-violation-of-the-code-of-conduct?)

* [Reporting a violation](#how-to-report-a-violation)

* [After you report a violation](#what-happens-after-you-report-a-violation)




> **Note:** This Code of Conduct is based on the Horizontal Code of Conduct which is adapted from the
Internet Freedom Festival, RightsCon, and Django Codes of Conduct.

Horizontal is committed to providing an inclusive, safe, and collaborative environment for all stakeholders, including staff, contractors, and board members, regardless of their gender, gender expression, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, sexual characteristics, physical appearance, disability, or age. We encourage everyone to be themselves, and must respect the rights of others. We do not tolerate harassment in any form.

This Code of Conduct embodies our commitment to uphold these principles and outlines
our expectations and our response. We also hope that this policy will promote values of
dignity, decency, and respect, and will enable each of us to contribute to a safe and
inclusive shared space.

The values of Horizontal are focused on developing both our individual and collective
potential, supporting and empowering the most marginalized, mutual respect, and an antiviolence approach that favors support and collaboration among stakeholders and the
resolution of conflicts. A code of conduct helps us co-exist in a more positive way, and provides individuals who are victims of negative behaviors with confidence that they will be supported by the organization.

Horizontal stakeholders are expected to understand and abide by this Code of Conduct.
Anyone who is found to have violated this policy may be sanctioned or asked to leave
Horizontal as a result.


## Principles

### Respect for Diversity & Inclusion:

We avoid comments, actions or propaganda that encourages discrimination related to
gender, gender expression, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, sexual characteristics, physical appearance, disability, or age.

### Respect Freedom of Expression:
We support an individual's freedom of expression, and will not make fun of accents or
make unsolicited grammatical corrections. We will strive to better understand each other by not assuming experiences or beliefs, and by clarifying meanings.

### Commitment to Non-Violence:
We will not engage in any type of violence or aggression, including verbal threats or
complaints, intimidation, stalking or harassment, whether physically or psychologically.

### Rejection of Sexual Harassment:
We understand sexual harassment as unwanted physical contact or insinuation of a sexual
nature, as well as displaying images, drawings or visual representations of any kind that objectify members of any gender or reinforce oppression. The only exception is if this is part of a program where showing these images is linked to program objectives of the program.

### Respect for Privacy:
We safeguard the privacy of the participants, and agree to follow Horizontal's Security & [Privacy Policy](). This includes refraining from tweeting, posting, or publishing information about other Horizontal stakeholder (including names and place of residency) unless given clear permission, and avoid any type of unauthorized video, audio recording, or photography.

### Support Positive Interactions Among Participants:
We are committed to engaging constructively with others at all times. We will not tolerate bullying, including requesting or mobilizing others, either in person or online, to bully others.

## What represents a violation of the Code of Conduct?

Horizontal prohibits harassment, including sexual harassment, of any kind. Harassment is any verbal, nonverbal, or physical conduct designed to threaten, intimidate, silence, or coerce. Harassment includes but is not limited to:

and discriminatory remarks disguised as humor, based on gender identity and
expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, religion, age, disability, or physical
appearance;

* Distribution, display, or discussion of written or graphic material that ridicules, insults, or shows hostility or disrespect toward an individual or group because of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, religion, age, disability, or physical appearance;

* Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent;
Deliberate misgendering or use of rejected names;

* Intimidation or silencing, including sustained and deliberate disruption of discussion or presentation;

* Failure to safeguard confidential or privately shared information, including
publication of private communication without consent;

* Unwelcome sexual attention, including innuendoes, suggestive comments, jokes of a
sexual nature, sexual propositions, lewd remarks and obscene gestures, and requests
for sexual favors (including repeated and unwelcome requests for dates);

* Distribution, display, or discussion of any sexually suggestive written or graphic
material, including emails, photos, text messages, and tweets, that is gratuitous, offtopic, or shows hostility or disrespect toward an individual or group;

* Unwelcome physical contact including inappropriate touching, tickling, pinching,
petting, brushing up against, hugging, cornering, kissing, fondling, and forced sexual
intercourse or assault.

* Encourage, support or assist violations of this Code of Conduct.


## When and where does the Code of Conduct apply?

This Code of Conduct applies in all Horizontal communications, interactions, convenings, and spaces, including websites, exchanges by email and other communication platforms, social media platforms, convenings such as organizational retreats, workshops, events, and meetings, both online and in-person.


## How to report a violation

If you see an incident, are victim of one, or have concerns about someone's conduct, please contact Raphael Mimoun at raphael@hzontal.org.

Weill work to ensure your safety, privacy, and the confidentiality of the report itself and the information that you are sharing. 

Raphael Mimoun (executive director):
* Email: raphael@hzontal.org
* Public Key (for PGP encrypted email): 0x3F1B2FDD

In your report please include:

* Your contact info (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up)
* Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there were
other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as well.
* When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.
* Your account of what occurred.
* Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.
* If you believe this incident is ongoing.
* Any other information you believe we should have.



## What happens after you report a violation?

You will receive an email acknowledging receipt
immediately and your case will be immediately reviewed to determine:

* What happened.
* Whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation.
* Who the bad actor was.
* Whether this is an ongoing situation, or if there is a threat to anyone's physical safety.

If this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to physical safety, the team's immediate priority will be to protect everyone involved. This means we may delay an "official" response until we believe that the situation has ended and that everyone is physically safe.

Once the People's Operations team has a complete account of the events they will make a
decision as to how to response. Responses may include:

* Nothing (if we determine no violation occurred).
* A private reprimand from the team to the individual(s) involved.
* A public reprimand.
* An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to "take a week off").
* A permanent or temporary ban from some or all Horizontal spaces (Asana, Mattermost,
emails, online or in-person meetings, etc)
* A request for a public or private apology.
* A termination of employment contract, independent contractor agreement, or
partnership agreement.

We'll respond within one week to the person who filed the report with either a resolution or an explanation of why the situation is not yet resolved.

Once we've determined our final action, we'll contact the original reporter to let them know what action (if any) we'll be taking. We'll take into account feedback from the reporter on the appropriateness of our response, but we don't guarantee we'll act on it.

Finally, the People's Operations team will make a report on the situation to the Horizontal Board of Directors. The board may choose to make a public report of the incident.
