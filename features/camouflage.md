# Camouflage

In order to protect the data produced and shared through Tella, the application and its content can be hidden on the user's device.

The app's icon can be changed to a seemingly harmless one, such as a calcultor or a camera. This means that an individual searching the device will not see the Tella name and icon, and instead see an app that doesn't raise suspicions.

WARNING: the name and icon of Tella will remain visible in the Android settings; this means that this camouflage will not protect against an individual _actively_ looking for Tella or conducting an in-depth analysis of the device. This is a good protection against superficial searches of the user's device, avoiding to raise suspicions if an individual is quickly searching for incriminating evidence.
