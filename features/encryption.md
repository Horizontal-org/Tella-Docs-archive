# Encryption

All of the content and data stored in Tella are encrypted.&#x20;

This means that unless the app is unlocked (using the 6-point pattern, PIN, or Password set up by the user), all the data will remain inaccessible to someone seizing or searching the device.&#x20;

Even if it is plugged into a computer and all of the device's data is extracted to be analyzed, all Tella content and data will look like gibberish and will be useless. Unlocking the app by entering the correct lock is the only way to decrypt, and therefore read, the content stored in Tella.
