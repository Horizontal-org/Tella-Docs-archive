# Encryption

All of the content and data stored in Tella are encrypted.&#x20;

This means that unless the app is unlocked all the data will remain inaccessible to someone seizing or searching the device.&#x20;

Upon installing the app, the user decides which lock method they would like to use (a six-point pattern, a PIN, or a password) and sets their lock. The app cannot be opened without the lock.

{% hint style="info" %}
WARNING: if the user forgets their lock, there is no way of gaining access to the app and retrieving its content
{% endhint %}

Even if it is plugged into a computer and all of the device's data is extracted to be analyzed, all Tella content and data will look like gibberish and will be useless. Unlocking the app by entering the correct lock is the only way to decrypt, and therefore read, the content stored in Tella.
