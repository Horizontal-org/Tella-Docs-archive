# File management

Tella allows users to manage files and folders in a similar way they would do on a computer. All files and folders are **encrypted and only accessible within Tella**.

In Tella, users can:

* Store any file, including photos, videos, audio files, and documents.
* Create folders and subfolders.
* Move files into folders and from one folder to another.
* Import files from their device. Files are automatically encrypted when imported into Tella.
* Export files to their device. Once saved on their device outside of Tella, files are no longer encrypted and can be accessed by anyone searching the device.
