# Where can I get Tella?

Tella is currently **only available on Android.** It [can be downloaded here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.hzontal.tella) on the Google Play Store. If privacy is concern, you can also download the APK (the app file) from [here](https://web.tresorit.com/l/qVStY#S67Ba-adBLc1y-iFpmWcCA).

We would love to develop an iOS version. If you want to help us get it on iPhone, contact us [here](https://hzontal.org).
