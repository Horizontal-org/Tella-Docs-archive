### &#x20;

### Tella 1.5 -- 25 May 2019

GENERAL:

* The audio recording screen never sleeps

DATA COLLECTION:

* More transparency and control on file submission: progress bar for file uploads, and decide which file to send immediately and which to save for later sending
* New form interface to attach files faster
* Users who don't use the Collect feature can disable it to hide the homescreen button

### Tella 1.4 -- 30 March 2019&#x20;

* A new offline mode allows users to collect data without having to worry about internet connectivity. All forms are saved for later submission.
* More transparency on the submission of forms: users can send attachments separately from the form, and decide which attachment to send. This is particularly useful when internet connectivity is spotty.&#x20;
* New user interface for the app's settings, for clearer navigation.
* Given Google's new privacy policy preventing the sending of SMS, the Panic Button was changed to a Quick Exit button, which wipes data and deletes the app. &#x20;
* Bug fixes and improvements.

### Tella 1.3 -- 19 March 2019

* Bug fixes and improvements

### Tella 1.2 -- 13 February 2019&#x20;

* Form admins can make it so that attaching a photo or video to a form also automatically attaches the file's geolocation metadata  to the form. This means admins can see on the map where all the verified photos and videos were taken.
* New drop-down appearance for multiple choice questions. This greatly improves the user experience when several questions are on the same screen.
* Bug fixes and improvements

### Tella 1.1 -- 3 February 2019&#x20;
