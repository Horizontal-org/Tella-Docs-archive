# Risks and limitations

No app is 100% secure.&#x20;

Here, we tried to list all the important security risks and limitations users should be aware of when using Tella:

* Camouflage:
  * Camouflaged app can still be detected in the Android Settings
* File management:
  * Files that are exported are no longer encrypted.
  * Files that are shared through third-party apps may be visible to those apps, and someone searching these apps may be able to find the files. For example: a photo shared on WhatsApp;&#x20;
  * Importing a file creates a copy of this file, and then imports it and encrypts into Tella. But this means the original file is still present on the phone, unencrypted. Important to use "Import and delete original" feature.&#x20;
